# ðŸŒ¾ Rice Disease Classification Using ResNet50
This project utilizes deep learning and Transfer Learning with ResNet50 to classify rice crop diseases.

### You can directly use the model available at : <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/Subh775/RiceSage">Here</a>

## ðŸ¬¬ Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a classification model to identifying the type of condition of rice crops.

## ðŸ¦… Key Features
**Disease Classification:** The model can classify rice crop images into four categories:
- **Brown Spot:** A fungal disease characterized by brown oval-shaped spots on leaves.
- **Healthy:** Represents rice plants without visible disease symptoms.
- **Leaf Blast:** Lesions caused by the fungus *Magnaporthe oryzae* on leaves.
- **Neck Blast:** Lesions affecting the panicle neck caused by the same fungus.

The dataset can be accessed at: [Rice Disease Classification Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Subh775/Rice-Disease-Classification)

## Training Highlights
- **Hardware:** Trained on two **Tesla T4** GPU
