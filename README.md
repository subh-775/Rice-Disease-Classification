# ðŸŒ¾ Rice Disease Classification Using ResNet50
This is a Machine Learning project on Rice Disease Classification using Transfer learning in ResNet50.

## ðŸ§­ Project Overview
This project focuses on building a deep learning-based model for identifying and classifying diseases in rice crops. Rice is a staple food for millions worldwide, and protecting it from diseases is crucial for ensuring food security. By utilizing a labeled dataset of rice crop images, this project aims to create an automated, accurate, and efficient disease detection system.

## ðŸ¦… Key Features
**Disease Classification:** The model identifies four categories:
- **Brown Spot:** Fungal disease characterized by brown oval-shaped spots on leaves.
- **Healthy:** Images of rice plants without disease symptoms.
- **Leaf Blast:** Lesions caused by Magnaporthe oryzae on leaves.
- **Neck Blast:** Lesions affecting the panicle neck caused by the same fungus.

## ðŸ”¨ ResNet Architecture
The model consists of:

**Initial Layers**
- A `Conv2d layer` with a 7x7 kernel, stride of 2, and padding of 3, followed by a BatchNorm and ReLU activation.
- A MaxPooling layer.

**Four Residual Layers** (`layer1`, `layer2`, `layer3`, `layer4`):
- Each layer consists of multiple Bottleneck blocks.
- The Bottleneck block contains three convolutional layers (`conv1`, `conv2`, `conv3`) with kernel sizes 1x1, 3x3, and 1x1 respectively.
- Skip connections (`downsample`) are used to match dimensions when needed.
  
**Key Points**
- The network starts with 64 filters and progressively increases to 2048 filters by the final residual block.
- Strides in the `conv2` layers and downsample layers reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps as the network deepens.
- ReLU activation is used after most layers.
