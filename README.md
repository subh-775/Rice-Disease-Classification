# ðŸŒ¾ Rice Disease Classification Using ResNet50
This is a Machine Learning project on Rice Disease Classification using Transfer learning in ResNet50.

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a deep learning-based model for identifying and classifying diseases in rice crops. Rice is a staple food for millions worldwide, and protecting it from diseases is crucial for ensuring food security. By utilizing a labeled dataset of rice crop images, this project aims to create an automated, accurate, and efficient disease detection system.

## Key Features
**Disease Classification:** The model identifies four categories:
- **Brown Spot:** Fungal disease characterized by brown oval-shaped spots on leaves.
- **Healthy:** Images of rice plants without disease symptoms.
- **Leaf Blast:** Lesions caused by Magnaporthe oryzae on leaves.
- **Neck Blast:** Lesions affecting the panicle neck caused by the same fungus.
