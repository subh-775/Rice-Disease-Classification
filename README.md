# ðŸŒ¾ Rice Disease Classification

## Project Evolution
This project has evolved through two major phases, improving classification accuracy of rice crop diseases using deep learning techniques.

### Phase 1: ResNet50 Implementation
The initial implementation utilized transfer learning with ResNet50 architecture:
- **Accuracy:** Achieved 79% classification accuracy
- **Training Details:**
  - Hardware: Tesla T4 GPU
  - Loss Function: CrossEntropy Loss
  - Optimizer: Adam
  - Training Epochs: 50
- **Limitations:** While functional, accuracy levels were insufficient for reliable field application

### Phase 2: EfficientNet-B3 Implementation
A significant improvement was achieved by switching to EfficientNet-B3 and using an augmented dataset:
- **Accuracy:** Improved to 94.30%
- **Dataset:** Enhanced with augmented samples from the original dataset
- **Dataset Source:** [Augmented Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Subh775/Rice-Disease-Augmented)

- Here's the original and augmented rows details:

## ðŸŒ¿ Disease Classification
The model classifies rice crop images into four categories:

| Disease | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Brown Spot** | Fungal disease characterized by brown oval-shaped spots on leaves |
| **Leaf Blast** | Lesions caused by the fungus *Magnaporthe oryzae* on leaves |
| **Neck Blast** | Lesions affecting the panicle neck, caused by the same fungus as leaf blast |
| **Healthy** | Rice plants without visible disease symptoms |

## ðŸ’¡ Impact
This project leverages cutting-edge deep learning techniques to address real-world agricultural challenges, empowering farmers with early and accurate disease detection capabilities. Early identification of rice diseases can lead to timely interventions, reduced crop losses, and more sustainable farming practices.
